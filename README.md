## Manual Build for Development

### For M1 Chip Macs üíª
At this moment, the project could only be compiled with `node` in `x64` binary version. 

Please check the installed binary version of your `node`:

```sh
node -p process.arch
x64
```
If `arm64` is returned, open your favourite Shell in Rosetta

```sh
arch -x86_64 /bin/bash
```

Reinstall `node` 14 or 15 under Rosetta. The reinstalled `node` will be in `x64` binary version by default. 

### Installation

```sh
yarn install
```
Installs all the needed dependencies

### Development & Builds Processes

#### Web Target üåê

```sh
yarn start
```
The command above runs the app as a normal web app in development, deployed at http://localhost:3000/

```sh
yarn build
```
Builds an optimized web distributable output for the repository.

The final output build should be ready to be deployed like any normal react web app. The /build folder is ready to be deployed üöÄ


#### Electron Target üíª

```sh
# Use webpack
yarn electron:dev

# Or use Vite(faster)
yarn vite:dev
```
Runs the Electron app in the development mode.

The Electron app will reload if you make edits in the electron directory.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


```sh
yarn electron:build
```
Builds the Electron app package for production to the dist folder.

The app is ready to be distributed!
